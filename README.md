# DevOps Squad
This repo captures the [DevOps](https://github.com/orgs/ModaOperandi/teams/devops-squad) approach at Moda Operandi, as well as the decisions made along the way.


## Core principles
The DevOps squad holds a set of [core principles](core-principles.md) that help drive decision-making. These are considered a living document, with squad members freely able to suggest amendments to the core principles via a [pull request](https://github.com/ModaOperandi/devops/pulls) and comment-driven approval of the PR.


## Discussions
In addition to the core principles, this repo is a place to drive squad-level [discussions and strategies](strategy/README.md).
