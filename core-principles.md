# Core Principles

* We capture best practices and provide them as defaults to other engineers while also providing non-default optionality within established guardrails.
* We are not gatekeepers or button-pushers. Whenever possible, we get out of the way and allow other engineers to own their software and resources.
* We make decisions as a group. When a decision is not unanimous, those in dissent agree to `disagree but commit`.
* We distribute ownership, both within and without the squad. No individual should be a single point of failure.
