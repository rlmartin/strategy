# Strategy
Squad-level discussions happen in [pull requests](https://github.com/ModaOperandi/devops/pulls) and end up in this directory as strategy.

There is no established format to the documents in this directory, though they should do their best to optimize for readability and searchability. If a strategy is merged to master, the implication is that it has been approved by the squad.


## Voting
All squad members should do their best to cast votes on PRs in a timely manner. The group has the option of merging PRs without the input of individuals if this expectation is not met.

All voting is done via PR reviews. Points for review comments are as follows:

```
Approve:         +1
Comment:         +0.5
No vote:         +0.5
Request changes: -3
```

In order to merge a PR, the average of the squad must be >= 0.5. Given that simple comments or non-votes maintain that average, this voting system should bias towards decision-making. Requesting changes should be seen as a veto and used rarely; it is up to this person to follow up with a commit that would drive towards approval. The approval process is repeated until the PR is either merged or closed without merging.


### Leveraging core principles
Sometimes the squad will either be unable to make a decision or may find the discussion taking too long. In these moments, the squad should look to the core principles for assistance. If there is not a core principle that helps with guidance, the squad should establish a new core principle to help in the future.
